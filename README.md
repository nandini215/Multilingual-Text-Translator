# Multilingual-Text-Translator
This Language Translator GUI application, built with Python and Tkinter, enables users to load text from images and PDFs, translate it into different languages, and view the translated text within the app. Using Tesseract OCR for text extraction and deep-translator for language translation, it supports multiple languages, such as Hindi and Kannada. Users can load images or PDFs to extract text, which is then translated through a simple and user-friendly interface. Key features include chunked text handling for efficient translation, error handling for invalid inputs, and easy file selection for loading source text, making this a versatile tool for real-time language translation.
